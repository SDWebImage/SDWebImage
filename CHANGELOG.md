## [5.6.0 - URLSession Metrics && Vector Format, on Mar 5th, 2020](https://github.com/rs/SDWebImage/releases/tag/5.6.0)
See [all tickets marked for the 5.6.0 release](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/milestone/63)

### Features

#### URLSession Metrics
- Added the URLSessionTaskMetrics support for downloader && operation, which can be used for network metrics #2937
- Typically you use custom operation class to collect all metrics in your app. You can also collect metrics for single url request level. Check the #2937 example code to grab the download token and check metrics.

#### Vector Image
- Feature - better support for vector format detection, now PDF rasterized bitmap is built-in #2936
- Pass `.thumbnailPixelSize` to control the PDF bitmap size. If you want vector PDF rendering, you still need to use [SDWebImagePDFCoder](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImagePDFCoder).
- Vector image like SVG (via [SDWebImageSVGCoder](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImageSVGCoder)) and PDF (via [SDWebImagePDFCoder](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImagePDFCoder)), or system symbol images, can be detected by new API `sd_isVector`.
- Vector image does not pass to transformer by default, because they support dynamic size changing. Pass `.transformVectorImage` option to allow transformation.

#### Cache
- Add a better check to handle the cases when call `storeImage` without imageData #2953
- Which means, if you store image to disk without data, we will use extra information via `sd_imageFormat` or custom image class, to choose the the image format (including GIF and PDF) for encoding. Previously we only encode it into PNG or JPEG.

#### Context Option
- Feature add context option for cache, loader and coder, deprecated SDWebImageContextCustomManager #2955
- This makes it easy to use custom loader, cache, and decoder, without need to create a dummy SDWebImageManager instance.

### Fixes
- Fix the rare case when call `SDWebImageDownloaderOperation.cancel`, the completion block may callback twice #2954

### Warnings
- Suppress the deprecation warning when min deployment target version set to iOS 13+ or macCatalyst
- Complete all the SDWebImage error code with the localized description, make it easy for debugging #2948

### Features

#### Thumbnail Decoding
- Supports to load the large web image with thumbnail, control the limit size and aspect ratio #2922 #2810
- Better than resize transformer, which does not allocate full pixel RAM and faster on CPU. If you've already use transformer to generate thumbnail, you'd better have a try
- Works for both animated images and progressive images, each frame using the thumbnail decoding
- Applies for Vector Format like SVG/PDF as well, see more in [Coder Plugin List](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/wiki/Coder-Plugin-List)

#### Core Image
- Support all transformer method on CIImage based UIImage/NSImage #2918
- For CIImage based UIImage/NSImage, using the CIFilter to take shortcut, which is faster and lazy (rasterize on demand)

#### Cache
- Support to use the creation date and the change date to determine the disk cache expire date compare #2915

### Performances
- Using UIGraphicsImageRenderer on iOS 10+, save memory when image bitmap is RGB(-25%) or Grayscale(-75%) #2907

### Features

#### Swift Package Manager

- Add support for Swift Package Manager #2756

#### Options Processor

- Supports global control on options and context for individual image request #2736

#### Context Option

- Supports store original image to cache for transformer via `SDWebImageContextOriginalStoreCacheType` #2590
- Add a new option `SDWebImageMatchAnimatedImageClass`, to ensure we always match the custom image class instead of UIImage/NSImage class #2801

#### Cache

### Project

- Follow App Store submit rule, upgrade the minimum Xcode version to Xcode 10.0 #2780
- Provide a script target to directly build all SDWebImage framework and generate all in one XCFramework from Xcode 11 #2764

### Notable Behavior Changes

- Ensure we always callback user's completion block even when cancelled with `SDWebImageErrorCancelled` error code #2692

This may effect some users. In previous 4.0~5.0 version, we will not callback completion block when we receive `cancel` call. (including all View Category/Cache/Manager/Downloader APIs)

But from 5.1, we always callback on this case with error code `SDWebImageErrorCancelled`. You can filter this error code if you don't care about cancel.

This change makes usages like Dispatch Group, observer, or any logic which relay on the completion's callback become acceptable, which is not reliable and will cause issue in previous versions.

- Change that the `sd_imageProgress` property to not auto-create instance by framework #2763

Now, we don't create the NSProgress object from internal method call, this does not affect user's KVO usage.

- Change the default value of accept request header #2772

Now, the default HTTP header filed `Accept`, use `image/*,*/*;q=0.8`, instead of `image/*;q=0.8`.

#### Backwards incompatible changes

See the [5.0 Migration Guide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rs/SDWebImage/master/Docs/SDWebImage-5.0-Migration-guide.md) for a list of comprehensive changes and the way to update your code

#### Features
- Introduce `SDAnimatedImageView`, `SDAnimatedImage` and refactor the way we handle animated images #2140
- Added APNG support via dedicated coder `SDImageAPNGCoder` #2149

## [4.0.0 beta - New platforms (Mac OS X and watchOS) + refactoring, on Oct 5th, 2016](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/releases/tag/4.0.0-beta)

See [all tickets marked for the 4.0.0 release](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/milestone/3)

#### Infrastructure:

- support for **watchOS** and **OS X** platforms #1595
- the `SDWebImage xcodeproj` contains the following targets:
    - `SDWebImage iOS static` (iOS static lib)
    - `SDWebImage watchOS static` (watchOS static lib)
    - `SDWebImage OSX` (OSX dynamic framework)
    - `SDWebImage iOS` (iOS dynamic framework)
    - `SDWebImage tvOS` (tvOS dynamic framework)
    - `SDWebImage watchOS` (watchOS dynamic framework)
  - the `SDWebImage Demo xcodeproj` contains the following targets:
    - `SDWebImage OSX Demo`
    - `SDWebImage iOS Demo`
    - `SDWebImage TV Demo`
    - `SDWebImage Watch Demo`
- bumped `libwep` version to `0.5.1`
- improved unit testing code coverage (*35%* -> **77%**) and integrated [CodeCov](https://codecov.io/gh/SDWebImage/SDWebImage)

#### Backwards incompatible changes

- removed all deprecated methods (that we carried around for backwards compatibility in previous versions) #774
- Renamed `SDWebImageManager` `downloadImageWithURL:options:progress:completed:` to `loadImageWithURL:options:progress:completed:` as it makes more sense, since we check the cache first and download only if needed a32a177
- Deleted targets: `SDWebImage+MKAnnotation`, `SDWebImage+WebP`, `SDWebImageFramework`:  
  - `SDWebImage `target that build as a static library (all subspecs included) -> `libSDWebImage.a`
  - `SDWebImageiOS` and `SDWebImagetvOS` targets that build as dynamic frameworks
- Renamed the dynamic frameworks targets from `WebImage` to `SDWebImage`. Renamed the `WebImage.h` to `SDWebImage.h` to match the framework naming
- Renamed the schemes for consistency. Updated the Tests Podfile + project.
- For #883 Fix multiple requests for same image and then canceling one, several breaking changes were needed:
  - `SDWebImageDownloader` method `- downloadImageWithURL:options:progress:completed:` now returns a `SDWebImageDownloadToken *` instead of `id <SDWebImageOperation>` (give the ability to cancel downloads using the returned token)
  - `SDWebImageDownloaderOperation` initializer `- initWithRequest:options:progress:completed:cancelled` split into `- initWithRequest:options` and `addHandlersForProgress:completed:`. Note: there is no more cancel block
- Modern Objective-C syntax done in 64382b9 includes:
  - initializers now return `instancetype` instead of `id`
  - explicit designated initializers (i.e. for `SDImageCache`)
- For #1575 GIF support using FLAnimatedImage, several changes were needed:
  - replaced type `SDWebImageQueryCompletedBlock` with `SDCacheQueryCompletedBlock` and added an `NSData *` param
  - because of the change above, the `done` param of `SDImageCache` `queryDiskCacheForKey:done:` is now a `SDCacheQueryCompletedBlock` and those blocks must now include an `NSData *` param
  - replaced type `SDWebImageCompletionWithFinishedBlock` with `SDInternalCompletionBlock` and added an `NSData *` param
  - because of the change above, the `completed` param of `SDWebImageManager` `loadImageWithURL:options:progress:completed:` is now `SDInternalCompletionBlock` and those blocks must now include an `NSData *` param
  - for consistency with the previous change, also renamed `SDWebImageCompletionBlock` to `SDExternalCompletionBlock`
  - `UIImage` will no longer respond to `sd_animatedGIFNamed:` or `sd_animatedImageByScalingAndCroppingToSize:`
- Xcode 7 Objective-C updates (Lightweight Generics and Nullability) #1581
  - breaks compatibility at least for Swift users of the framework
- **watchOS** and **OS X** support #1595 required
  - renamed `SDWebImage` iOS static lib target to `SDWebImage iOS static` for clarity
- improving the unit tests code coverage #1681 required
  - Refactored `NSData` `ImageContentType` category, instead of returning the contentType as a string, the new added method `sd_imageFormatForImageData` will return a `SDImageFormat` enum value
  - `SDImageCache` configuration properties moved into `SDImageCacheConfig` (which is now available via `config` property):
    - `shouldDecompressImages`
    - `shouldDisableiCloud`
    - `shouldCacheImagesInMemory`
    - `maxCacheAge`
    - `maxCacheSize`
  - The `storeImage:` methods from `SDImageCache` were async already, but declared as sync. Properly marked them as async + added completion. Got rid of the recalculate param. If the `NSData` is provided, use it. Otherwise, recalculate from the `UIImage`
  - Removed the synchronous methods `diskImageExistsForURL:` and `cachedImageExistsForURL:` from `SDWebImageManager`
  - Removed the synchronous method `diskImageExistsWithKey:` from `SDImageCache`
  - Get rid of the confusion caused by `cleanDisk` and `clearDisk` on `SDImageCache`. Renamed `cleanDisk` to `deleteOldFiles`. No longer expose the sync `clearDisk` and `deleteOldFiles`, just the async ones.
  - Renamed `SDImageCache` `queryDiskCacheForKey:done:` to `queryCacheOperationForKey:done:`
  - Another `SDImageCache` clarification: `imageFromDiskCacheForKey:` used to also check the memory cache which I think is misleading. Now `imageFromDiskCacheForKey` only checks the disk cache and the new method `imageFromCacheForKey` checks both caches
  - Got rid of `removeImageForKey:` and `removeImageForKey:fromDisk:` from `SDImageCache` that looked sync but were async. Left only the 2 async ones
  - Removed `UIImageView` `sd_cancelCurrentHighlightedImageLoad`
- Added `sd_` prefix to the activity indicator related methods (`setShowActivityIndicatorView:`, `setIndicatorStyle:`, `showActivityIndicatorView`, `addActivityIndicator`, `removeActivityIndicator`) #1640
- Use `dispatch_main_async_safe` for all the completion blocks on the main queue (used to be `dispatch_sync`) - avoiding locks.
- Removed `dispatch_main_sync_safe` as it can be mistakenly used
- Add `url` as param to progress block `SDWebImageDownloaderProgressBlock` - #984

#### Features:

- Switched our GIF support to a better implementation: [FLAnimatedImage by Flipboard](https://github.com/Flipboard/FLAnimatedImage) #1575
  - requires iOS 8+ (it's the only way due to FLAnimatedImage requirements)
  - the implementation relies on a `WebCache` category on top of `FLAnimatedImageView`
  - details in the [README](README.md#animated-images-gif-support)
- Converted any remaining code to Modern Objective-C syntax - 64382b9
- Xcode 7 Objective-C updates (Lightweight Generics and Nullability) #1581
- via #1595 Clarified and simplified the usage of `TARGET_OS_*` macros. Added `SD_MAC`, `SD_UIKIT`, `SD_IOS`, `SD_TV`, `SD_WATCH`. The biggest issue here was `TARGET_OS_MAC` was 1 for all platforms and we couldn't rely on it.
- Replaces #1398 Allow to customise cache and image downloader instances used with `SDWebImageManager` - added a new initializer (`initWithCache:downloader:`) 9112170
- `UIImage` responds to `sd_imageData` and `sd_imageDataAsFormat:` via the `MultiFormat` category. Those methods transform a `UIImage` to the `NSData` representation 82d1f2e
- Created `SDWebImageDownloaderOperationInterface` to describe the behavior of a downloader operation. Any custom operation must conform to this protocol df3b6a5
- Refactored all the duplicate code from our `WebCache` categories into a `UIView` `WebCache` category. All the other categories will make calls to this one. Customization of setting the image is done via the `setImageBlock` and the `operationKey` e1840c3
- Due to the change above, the activity indicator can now be added to `UIButton`, `MKAnnotationView`, `UIImageView`
- Animated WebP support #1438
- The shared objects (not really singletons) should allow subclassing, therefore the return type of the shared resource method should be `instancetype` and not a fixed type - c57cf7e
- Allow to specify `NSURLSessionConfiguration` for `SDWebImageDownloader` #1654
- Add `url` as param to progress block `SDWebImageDownloaderProgressBlock` - #984

#### Fixes:

- Fix multiple requests for same image and then canceling one #883 + 8a78586
- Fixed #1444 and the master build thanks to [@kenmaz](https://github.com/kenmaz/SDWebImage/commit/5034c334be50765dfe4e97c48bcb74ef64175188)
- Fixed an issue with the `SDWebImageDownloaderOperation` : `cancelInternal` was not called because of the old mechanism rellying on the `thread` property - probably because that thread did not have a runloop. Removed that and now cancelInternal is called as expected f4bdae6
- Replaced #781 on replacing dispatch_sync with dispatch_async for the main queue 062e50a f7e8246 c77adf4 fdb8b2c 265ace4 0c47bc3. Check for main queue instead of main thread.
- Fixed #1619 iOS 10 crash (`setObjectForKey: object cannot be nil`) - #1676 7940577
- Fixed #1326 #1424 (`Carthage bitcode issue`) - #1593
- Fixed #1639 via #1657 (`Add support for downloading images behind redirect`)
- Replaced #1537 via 9cd6779 - fixed a potential retain cycle
- Updated `dispatch_main_async_safe` macro in order to avoid redefinition when included as Pod
- Fixed #1089 by updating the docs on the calling queue for the `progressBlock` (background queue)
- Fixed a compilation issue on `FLAnimatedImageView+WebCache` - #1687

## [3.8.2 Patch release for 3.8.0 on Sep 5th, 2016](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/releases/tag/3.8.2)

#### Fixes:

- Fixed #1608 #1623 #1644 Crash in `[NSURLCache cachedResponseForRequest:]` -  the fix is actually avoiding to access `NSURLCache` which appears to generate a race condition. We only call it if necesarry (`SDWebImageRefreshCached` is used and the image cannot be cached by the system when it's too big or behind authentication)

## [3.8.1 Patch release for 3.8.0 on Jun 7th, 2016](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/releases/tag/3.8.1)
