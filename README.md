## For Apple visionOS

From 5.18.0, SDWebImage can be compiled for visionOS platform. However, it's still in beta and may contains issues unlike the stable iOS UIKit support. Welcome to have a try and [report issue](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/issues).

To build on visionOS, currently we only support the standard Xcode integration.

See `Installation with Swift Package Manager` and `Manual Installation Guide` below.

Once the visionOS toolchain is stable, we will add the other package manager support later (include CocoaPods).

## Supported Image Formats

- Image formats supported by Apple system (JPEG, PNG, TIFF, BMP, ...), including [GIF](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/wiki/Advanced-Usage#gif-coder)/[APNG](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/wiki/Advanced-Usage#apng-coder) animated image
- HEIC format from iOS 11/macOS 10.13, including animated HEIC from iOS 13/macOS 10.15 via [SDWebImageHEICCoder](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/wiki/Advanced-Usage#heic-coder). For lower firmware, use coder plugin [SDWebImageHEIFCoder](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImageHEIFCoder)
- WebP format from iOS 14/macOS 11.0 via [SDWebImageAWebPCoder](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/wiki/Advanced-Usage#awebp-coder). For lower firmware, use coder plugin [SDWebImageWebPCoder](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImageWebPCoder)
- Support extendable coder plugins for new image formats like BPG, AVIF. And vector format like PDF, SVG. See all the list in [Image coder plugin List](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/wiki/Coder-Plugin-List)

## Additional modules and Ecosystem

In order to keep SDWebImage focused and limited to the core features, but also allow extensibility and custom behaviors, during the 5.0 refactoring we focused on modularizing the library.
As such, we have moved/built new modules to [SDWebImage org](https://github.com/SDWebImage).

#### SwiftUI
[SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) is an innovative UI framework written in Swift to build user interfaces across all Apple platforms.

We support SwiftUI by building a brand new framework called [SDWebImageSwiftUI](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImageSwiftUI), which is built on top of SDWebImage core functions (caching, loading and animation).

The new framework introduce two View structs `WebImage` and `AnimatedImage` for SwiftUI world, `ImageIndicator` modifier for any View, `ImageManager` observable object for data source. Supports iOS 13+/macOS 10.15+/tvOS 13+/watchOS 6+ and Swift 5.1. Have a nice try and provide feedback!

## How To Use

* Objective-C

```objective-c
#import <SDWebImage/SDWebImage.h>
...
[imageView sd_setImageWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://www.domain.com/path/to/image.jpg"]
             placeholderImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"placeholder.png"]];
```

* Swift

```swift
import SDWebImage

imageView.sd_setImage(with: URL(string: "http://www.domain.com/path/to/image.jpg"), placeholderImage: UIImage(named: "placeholder.png"))
```

- For details about how to use the library and clear examples, see [The detailed How to use](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/blob/master/Docs/HowToUse.md)

## Animated Images (GIF) support

In 5.0, we introduced a brand new mechanism for supporting animated images. This includes animated image loading, rendering, decoding, and also supports customizations (for advanced users).

This animated image solution is available for `iOS`/`tvOS`/`macOS`. The `SDAnimatedImage` is subclass of `UIImage/NSImage`, and `SDAnimatedImageView` is subclass of `UIImageView/NSImageView`, to make them compatible with the common frameworks APIs.

The `SDAnimatedImageView` supports the familiar image loading category methods, works like drop-in replacement for `UIImageView/NSImageView`.

Don't have `UIView` (like `WatchKit` or `CALayer`)? you can still use `SDAnimatedPlayer` the player engine for advanced playback and rendering.

See [Animated Image](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/wiki/Advanced-Usage#animated-image-50) for more detailed information.

* Objective-C

```objective-c
SDAnimatedImageView *imageView = [SDAnimatedImageView new];
SDAnimatedImage *animatedImage = [SDAnimatedImage imageNamed:@"image.gif"];
imageView.image = animatedImage;
```

* Swift

```swift
let imageView = SDAnimatedImageView()
let animatedImage = SDAnimatedImage(named: "image.gif")
imageView.image = animatedImage
```

#### FLAnimatedImage integration has its own dedicated repo
In order to clean up things and make our core project do less things, we decided that the `FLAnimatedImage` integration does not belong here. From 5.0, this will still be available, but under a dedicated repo [SDWebImageFLPlugin](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImageFLPlugin).

## Installation

There are four ways to use SDWebImage in your project:
- using CocoaPods
- using Carthage
- using Swift Package Manager
- manual install (build frameworks or embed Xcode Project)

### Installation with CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries in your projects. See the [Get Started](http://cocoapods.org/#get_started) section for more details.

#### Podfile
```
platform :ios, '8.0'
pod 'SDWebImage', '~> 5.0'
```

##### Swift and static framework

Swift project previously had to use `use_frameworks!` to make all Pods into dynamic framework to let CocoaPods work.

However, starting with `CocoaPods 1.5.0+` (with `Xcode 9+`), which supports to build both Objective-C && Swift code into static framework. You can use modular headers to use SDWebImage as static framework, without the need of `use_frameworks!`:

```
platform :ios, '8.0'
# Uncomment the next line when you want all Pods as static framework
# use_modular_headers!
pod 'SDWebImage', :modular_headers => true
```

See more on [CocoaPods 1.5.0 — Swift Static Libraries](http://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-1.5.0/)

If not, you still need to add `use_frameworks!` to use SDWebImage as dynamic framework:

```
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!
pod 'SDWebImage'
```

#### Subspecs

There are 2 subspecs available now: `Core` and `MapKit` (this means you can install only some of the SDWebImage modules. By default, you get just `Core`, so if you need `MapKit`, you need to specify it). 

Podfile example:

```
pod 'SDWebImage/MapKit'
```

### Installation with Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a lightweight dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C. It leverages CocoaTouch modules and is less invasive than CocoaPods.

To install with carthage, follow the instruction on [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

Carthage users can point to this repository and use whichever generated framework they'd like: SDWebImage, SDWebImageMapKit or both.

Make the following entry in your Cartfile: `github "SDWebImage/SDWebImage"`
Then run `carthage update`
If this is your first time using Carthage in the project, you'll need to go through some additional steps as explained [over at Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#adding-frameworks-to-an-application).

> NOTE: At this time, Carthage does not provide a way to build only specific repository subcomponents (or equivalent of CocoaPods's subspecs). All components and their dependencies will be built with the above command. However, you don't need to copy frameworks you aren't using into your project. For instance, if you aren't using `SDWebImageMapKit`, feel free to delete that framework from the Carthage Build directory after `carthage update` completes.

### Installation with Swift Package Manager (Xcode 11+)

[Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) (SwiftPM) is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code as well as C-family dependency. From Xcode 11, SwiftPM got natively integrated with Xcode.

SDWebImage support SwiftPM from version 5.1.0. To use SwiftPM, you should use Xcode 11 to open your project. Click `File` -> `Swift Packages` -> `Add Package Dependency`, enter [SDWebImage repo's URL](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage.git). Or you can login Xcode with your GitHub account and just type `SDWebImage` to search.

After select the package, you can choose the dependency type (tagged version, branch or commit). Then Xcode will setup all the stuff for you.

If you're a framework author and use SDWebImage as a dependency, update your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
let package = Package(
    // 5.1.0 ..< 6.0.0
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage.git", from: "5.1.0")
    ],
    // ...
)
```

### Manual Installation Guide

+ Check your command line Xcode version

```
sudo xcode-select -s /path/to/Xcode.app
```

or

```
export DEVELOPER_DIR=/path/to/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
```

+ Run the script to build frameworks

```
./Scripts/build-frameworks.sh
```

+ Run the script to merge XCFramework

```
./Scripts/create-xcframework.sh
```

See more on wiki: [Manual install Guide](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/wiki/Installation-Guide#manual-installation-guide)

### Import headers in your source files

In the source files where you need to use the library, import the umbrella header file:

```objective-c
#import <SDWebImage/SDWebImage.h>
```

It's also recommend to use the module import syntax, available for CocoaPods(enable `modular_headers`)/Carthage/SwiftPM.

```objecitivec
@import SDWebImage;
```

### Build Project

At this point your workspace should build without error. If you are having problem, post to the Issue and the
community can help you solve it.

## Data Collection Practices

From Xcode 15, we provide the new `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` file for privacy details, see [Describing data use in privacy manifests](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files/describing_data_use_in_privacy_manifests?language=objc)

You can exports the privacy report after archive your App by integrate SDWebImage via SwiftPM/XCFramework or CocoaPods (`use_framework` set to true).

For old version or if you're using static ar archive, as required by the [App privacy details on the App Store](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/), here's SDWebImage's list of [Data Collection Practices](https://sdwebimage.github.io/DataCollection/index.html).
