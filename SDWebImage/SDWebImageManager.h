/**
 * The SDWebImageManager is the class behind the UIImageView+WebCache category and likes.
 * It ties the asynchronous downloader (SDWebImageDownloader) with the image cache store (SDImageCache).
 * You can use this class directly to benefit from web image downloading with caching in another context than
 * a UIView.
 *
 * Here is a simple example of how to use SDWebImageManager:
 *
 *  SDWebImageManager *manager = [SDWebImageManager sharedManager];
 *  [manager downloadWithURL:imageURL
 *                  delegate:self
 *                   options:0
 *                   success:^(UIImage *image)
 *                   {
 *                       // do something with image
 *                   }
 *                   failure:nil];
