/**
 These following graphics context method are provided to easily write cross-platform(AppKit/UIKit) code.
 For UIKit, these methods just call the same method in `UIGraphics.h`. See the documentation for usage.
 For AppKit, these methods use `NSGraphicsContext` to create image context and match the behavior like UIKit.
 @note If you don't care bitmap format (ARGB8888) and just draw image, use `SDGraphicsImageRenderer` instead. It's more performant on RAM usage.`
