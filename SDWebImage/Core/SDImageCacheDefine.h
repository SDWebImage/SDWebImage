 This is the image cache protocol to provide custom image cache for `SDWebImageManager`.
 Though the best practice to custom image cache, is to write your own class which conform `SDMemoryCache` or `SDDiskCache` protocol for `SDImageCache` class (See more on `SDImageCacheConfig.memoryCacheClass & SDImageCacheConfig.diskCacheClass`).
 However, if your own cache implementation contains more advanced feature beyond `SDImageCache` itself, you can consider to provide this instead. For example, you can even use a cache manager like `SDImageCachesManager` to register multiple caches.
