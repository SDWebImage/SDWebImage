/**
 A subclass of `NSBitmapImageRep` to fix that GIF duration issue because `NSBitmapImageRep` will reset `NSImageCurrentFrameDuration` by using `kCGImagePropertyGIFDelayTime` but not `kCGImagePropertyGIFUnclampedDelayTime`.
 This also fix the GIF loop count issue, which will use the Netscape standard (See http://www6.uniovi.es/gifanim/gifabout.htm)  to only place once when the `kCGImagePropertyGIFLoopCount` is nil. This is what modern browser's behavior.
 Built in GIF coder use this instead of `NSBitmapImageRep` for better GIF rendering. If you do not want this, only enable `SDImageIOCoder`, which just call `NSImage` API and actually use `NSBitmapImageRep` for GIF image.
 This also support APNG format using `SDImageAPNGCoder`. Which provide full alpha-channel support and the correct duration match the `kCGImagePropertyAPNGUnclampedDelayTime`.
