 For UIKit, this will apply the patch and then create animated UIImage. The patch is because that `+[UIImage animatedImageWithImages:duration:]` just use the average of duration for each image.

 For AppKit, NSImage does not support animates other than GIF. This will try to encode the frames to GIF format and then create an animated NSImage for rendering.
