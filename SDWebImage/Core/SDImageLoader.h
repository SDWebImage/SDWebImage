 @param imageData The image data from the network so far. Should not be nil
 @param imageURL The image URL from the input. Should not be nil
 @param finished Pass NO to specify the download process has not finished. Pass YES when all image data has finished.
 @param operation The loader operation associated with current progressive download. Why to provide this is because progressive decoding need to store the partial decoded context for each operation to avoid conflict. You should provide the operation from `loadImageWithURL:` method return value.

 @param context The context arg from the input

/**
 This is the protocol to specify custom image load process. You can create your own class to conform this protocol and use as a image loader to load image from network or any available remote resources defined by yourself.
 If you want to implement custom loader for image download from network or local file, you just need to concentrate on image data download only. After the download finish, call `SDImageLoaderDecodeImageData` or `SDImageLoaderDecodeProgressiveImageData` to use the built-in decoding process and produce image (Remember to call in the global queue). And finally callback the completion block.
 If you directly get the image instance using some third-party SDKs, such as image directly from Photos framework. You can process the image data and image instance by yourself without that built-in decoding process. And finally callback the completion block.
 @note It's your responsibility to load the image in the desired global queue(to avoid block main queue). We do not dispatch these method call in a global queue but just from the call queue (For `SDWebImageManager`, it typically call from the main queue).
