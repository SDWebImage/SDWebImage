/**
 A drop-in replacement for UIImageView/NSImageView, you can use this for animated image rendering.
 Call `setImage:` with `UIImage(NSImage)` which conform to `SDAnimatedImage` protocol will start animated image rendering. Call with normal UIImage(NSImage) will back to normal UIImageView(NSImageView) rendering
 For UIKit: use `-startAnimating`, `-stopAnimating` to control animating. `isAnimating` to check animation state.
 For AppKit: use `-setAnimates:` to control animating, `animates` to check animation state. This view is layer-backed.
