/**
 Built in coder that supports PNG, JPEG, TIFF, includes support for progressive decoding.
 
 GIF
 Also supports static GIF (meaning will only handle the 1st frame).
 For a full GIF support, we recommend `FLAnimatedImage` or our less performant `SDWebImageGIFCoder`
 
 HEIC
 This coder also supports HEIC format because ImageIO supports it natively. But it depends on the system capabilities, so it won't work on all devices, see: https://devstreaming-cdn.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2017/511tj33587vdhds/511/511_working_with_heif_and_hevc.pdf
