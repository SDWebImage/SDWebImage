Alternatively, if this causes compilation problems with frameworks that extend optional libraries, such as Parse,  RestKit or opencv2, instead of the -ObjC flag use:
```
-force_load SDWebImage.framework/Versions/Current/SDWebImage
```

If you're using Cocoa Pods and have any frameworks that extend optional libraries, such as Parsen RestKit or opencv2, instead of the -ObjC flag use:
```
-force_load $(TARGET_BUILD_DIR)/libPods.a
```
and this:
```
$(inherited)
```
