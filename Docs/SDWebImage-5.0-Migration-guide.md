## SDWebImage 5.0 Migration Guide

SDWebImage 5.0 is the latest major release of SDWebImage, a top library for downloading and caching images.
As a major release, following [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) conventions, 5.0 introduces several API-breaking changes with its new architecture.

This guide is provided in order to ease the transition of existing applications using SDWebImage 4.X to the latest APIs, as well as explain the design and structure of new and changed functionality.

### Requirements: iOS 8, Mac OS X 10.10, watchOS 2, tvOS 9, Xcode 9

SDWebImage 5.0 officially supports iOS 8 and later, Mac OS X 10.10 and later, watchOS 2 and later and tvOS 9 and later.
It needs Xcode 9 or later to be able to build everything properly.

For targeting previous versions of the SDKs, check [README - Backwards compatibility](https://github.com/rs/SDWebImage#backwards-compatibility).

### Migration

Using the view categories brings no change from 4.x to 5.0. 

Objective-C:

```objective-c
[imageView sd_setImageWithURL:url placeholderImage:placeholderImage];
```

Swift:

```swift
imageView.sd_setImage(with: url, placeholderImage: placeholder)
```

However, all view categories in 5.0 introduce a new extra arg called `SDWebImageContext`. This param can hold anything, as oposed to the previous `SDWebImageOptions` enum limitations. This gives developers advanced control for the behavior of image loading (cache, loader, etc). See the declaration for `SDWebImageContext` for detailed information.

### New Feature

#### Animated Image View

In 5.0, we introduced a brand new mechanism for supporting animated images. This includes animated image loading, rendering, decoding, and also supports customizations (for advanced users).

This animated image solution is available for `iOS`/`tvOS`/`macOS`. The `SDAnimatedImage` is subclass of `UIImage/NSImage`, and `SDAnimatedImageView` is subclass of `UIImageView/NSImageView`, to make them compatible with the common frameworks APIs. See [Animated Image](https://github.com/rs/SDWebImage/wiki/Advanced-Usage#animated-image-50) for more detailed information.

#### Image Transformer

In 5.0, we introduced an easy way to hook an image transformation process after the image was downloaded from network. This allows the user to easily scale, rotate, add rounded corner the original image and even chain a list of transformations. These transformed images will also be stored to the cache as they are after transformation. The reasons for this decision are: avoiding redoing the transformations (which can lead to unwanted behavior) and also time saving. See [Image Transformer](https://github.com/rs/SDWebImage/wiki/Advanced-Usage#image-transformer-50) for more detailed information.

#### Customization

In 5.0, we refactored our framework architecture in many aspects. This makes our framework easier to customize for advanced users, without the need for hooking anything or forking. We introduced [Custom Cache](https://github.com/rs/SDWebImage/wiki/Advanced-Usage#custom-cache-50) to control detailed cache loading behavior, and separate the memory cache & disk cache implementation. We introduced [Custom Loader](https://github.com/rs/SDWebImage/wiki/Advanced-Usage#custom-loader-50) to allow custom loading from your own source (doesn't have to be the network). And also, we changed the current [Custom Coder](https://github.com/rs/SDWebImage/wiki/Advanced-Usage#custom-coder-420) to work better for custom image decoder/encoder and animated images.

#### View Indicator
In 5.0, we refactored the image loading indicator API into a better and extensible API for `iOS`/`tvOS`/`macOS`. This is suitable for easy usage like providing a loading view during the image loading process. See [View Indicator](https://github.com/rs/SDWebImage/wiki/How-to-use#use-view-indicator-50) for more detailed information.

#### FLAnimatedImage support moved to a dedicated plugin repo

In order to clean up things and make our core project do less things, we decided that the `FLAnimatedImage` integration does not belong here. From 5.0, this will still be available, but under a dedicated repo [SDWebImageFLPlugin](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImageFLPlugin).

#### Photos Plugin

By taking the advantage of the [Custom Loader](https://github.com/rs/SDWebImage/wiki/Advanced-Usage#custom-loader-50) feature, we introduced a plugin to allow easy loading images from the Photos Library. See [SDWebImagePhotosPlugin](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImagePhotosPlugin) for more detailed information.


### Notable Behavior Changes

#### Cache

`SDImageCache` in 5.x, use `~/Library/Caches/com.hackemist.SDImageCache/default/` as default cache path. However, 4.x use `~/Library/Caches/default/com.hackemist.SDWebImageCache.default/`. And don't be worried, we will do the migration automatically once the shared cache initialized.

However, if you have some other custom namespace cache instance, you should try to do migration by yourself. But typically, since the cache is designed to be invalid at any time, you'd better not to bind some important logic related on that cache path changes.

And, if you're previously using any version from `5.0.0-beta` to `5.0.0-beta3`, please note that the cache folder has been temporarily moved to `~/Library/Caches/default/com.hackemist.SDImageCache.default/`, however, the final release version of 5.0.0 use the path above. If you upgrade from those beta version, you may need manually do migration, check `+[SDDiskCache moveCacheDirectoryFromPath:toPath:]` for detail information.

#### Prefetcher

`SDWebImagePrefetcher` in 5.x, change the concept of fetching batch of URLs. Now, each time you call `prefetchURLs:`, you will get a token which represents the specified URLs list. It does not cancel the previous URLs which is prefetching, which make the shared prefetcher behaves more intuitively.

However, in 4.x, each time you call `prefetchURLs:`, it will cancel all previous URLs which is been prefetching.

If you still want the same behavior, manually call `cancelPrefetching` each time before any `prefetchURLs:` calls.


+ Objective-C

```objective-c
SDWebImagePrefetcher *prefetcher = SDWebImagePrefetcher.sharedImagePrefetcher;
[prefetcher cancelPrefetching];
[prefetcher prefetchURLs:@[url1, url2]];
```

+ Swift

```swift
let prefetcher = SDWebImagePrefetcher.shared
prefetcher.cancelPrefetching()
prefetcher.prefetchURLs([url1, url2])
```
